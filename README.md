## About

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms and data structures in C++. It includes both fundamental algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.) and advanced topics like graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and more. 

## Features

- **C++ Language**: Code is written in C++.
- **Clean and Modular Code**: Each algorithm is separated for clarity.
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**: Covers a wide range of topics from basic to advanced.
- **Documentation**: Each algorithm includes comments explaining its functionality and time complexity.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Cpp-Algorithms.git
    cd Cpp-Algorithms
    ```

2. **Compile a specific file**:

    ```bash
    g++ filename.cpp -o output
    ./output
    ```
